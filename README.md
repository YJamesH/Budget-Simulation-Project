# Budget Simulation and Name Your Price Tool

## What I Do
I estimate what a Highland Contract can do to your current budget!

After entering inputs...

**Budget Simulation**
-  Graph 1 (top left) will display a Budget Neutral Transition:
    -   Current budget vs. Your budget with the Highland Contract. Savings will also be shaded in!
-  Graph 2 (top right) will display a Bottom Up Analysis of your budget:
    -   Current budget vs. Operating + Personnel + Capital Costs + Highland Contract
-  Graph 3 (bottom left) will display a line graph for CO2 reduction by switching to EVs
-  Graph 4 (bottom right) will display a short term Bottom Up Analysis:
    -   Similar to Graph 2, but with a 5 year time span.
    
**Name Your Price**
-  The table will display a contract price averaged to be within your budget per year including the number of vehicles you will recieve per year.
-  A maximum total deployment number is also calculated to figure out how many electric buses can be afforded

## Important things to note:
Do **NOT** move file and folder locations relative to each other.

Move the 'Deploy' folder as one

No need to access the files in the 'Settings' folder!
