# Budget Simulation and Name Your Price Tool

## What I Do
I estimate what a Highland Contract can do to your current budget!

After entering inputs...

**Budget Simulation**
-  Graph 1 (top left) displays a Budget Neutral Transition:
    -   Current budget vs. Your budget with the Highland Contract. Savings are also shown!
-  Graph 2 (top right) displays a Bottom Up Analysis of your budget:
    -   Current budget vs. Operating + Personnel + Capital Costs + Highland Contract
-  Graph 3 (bottom left) displays a line graph for CO2 reduction by switching to EVs
-  Graph 4 (bottom right) displays a short term Bottom Up Analysis:
    -   Graph 2, but with a 5 year time span.
    
**Name Your Price**
-  The table will display an estimated contract price calculated from how many vehicles can be received per year.
-  A maximum total deployment number is also calculated to displayan estimated number of electric buses able to be afforded.
