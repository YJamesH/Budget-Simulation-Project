# Budget Simulation App and Name-Your-Price Tool

## What I Do
I estimate what a Highland Contract can do to your current budget!

This project revolves around an app designed to illustrate the long-term cost-saving potential of Highland Contracts. These contracts, often spanning 15 to 20 years, are projected to generate savings of 10% or more compared to current expenditures, with savings typically increasing as the contract progresses towards its end. The app's primary goal is to provide users with visual graphs of estimated savings and benefits, along with and a more in-depth look into the contract breakdown.

This app was created under the West Fleet Team at Highland Electric Fleets.

After entering inputs...

**Budget Simulation**
-  Graph 1 (top left) displays a Budget Neutral Transition:
    -   Current budget vs. Your budget with the Highland Contract. Savings are also shown!
-  Graph 2 (top right) displays a Bottom Up Analysis of your budget:
    -   Current budget vs. Operating + Personnel + Capital Costs + Highland Contract
-  Graph 3 (bottom left) displays a line graph for CO2 reduction by switching to EVs
-  Graph 4 (bottom right) displays a short term Bottom Up Analysis:
    -   Graph 2, but with a 5 year time span.
    
**Name Your Price**
-  The table will display an estimated contract price calculated from how many vehicles can be received per year.
-  A maximum total deployment number is also calculated to displayan estimated number of electric buses able to be afforded.
